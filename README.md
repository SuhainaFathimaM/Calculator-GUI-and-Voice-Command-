# Python Calculator with GUI and Voice Command

## Overview

This project is a Python-based calculator that features a graphical user interface (GUI) and voice command capabilities. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations either by clicking buttons on the GUI or by speaking commands. Additionally, the calculator supports switching between light and dark modes for a better user experience.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface:** Built with Tkinter for intuitive user interaction.
- **Voice Commands:** Integrated using the SpeechRecognition library to allow voice-based input.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Uses pyttsx3 to provide voice feedback for results.
- **Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Dynamic Themable UI:** Allows switching between light and dark modes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/python-calculator.git
